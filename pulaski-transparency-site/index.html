            <h2>What This Is:</h2>
            <p>For too long, our township has mistaken more meetings for more transparency. Most people can't take off work, hire babysitters, or sit through hours of discussion just to stay informed.</p>
            
            <p>So instead of showing up to their meetings, I'm bringing the meetings to you.</p>
            
            <p>This project collects, transcribes, and summarizes official township meeting recordings to provide an accessible record of what's really happening in our local government.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- How It Works -->
        <section id="how-it-works">
            <h2>How It Works:</h2>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> I request official meeting recordings through Pennsylvania's Right-to-Know process (as of creating this website the township has been uncooperative with proactively providing information in the name of transparency).</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Each recording is transcribed using an open-source Python-based system that runs locally (no cloud storage or data selling).</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The transcript is summarized using AI to cut through filler and produce a clear, factual overview of what was said — including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Main discussion topics</li>
                    <li>Public concerns</li>
                    <li>Decisions and agreements</li>
                    <li>Notable moments</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <p>These are no-spin summaries. They may not be perfect (transcription depends on how clearly people speak) but they're a step in the right direction.</p>

        <!-- Why It Matters -->
        <section id="why">
            <h2>Why It Matters:</h2>
            <p>Transparency isn't about having more meetings. It's about making information public and accessible — without barriers.</p>
            
            <p>When residents can review meetings on their own time, they can ask better questions, hold leaders accountable, and participate without being shut out by scheduling or politics.</p>
            
            <p>This project is meant to reduce confusion, not create it, and to replace gossip and gatekeeping with data, documentation, and plain language.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- The Bigger Picture -->
        <section id="bigger-picture">
            <h2>The Bigger Picture:</h2>
            <p>In small-town politics, information is power. But power only balances when everyone has access to the same information.</p>
            
            <p>By publishing these records, we move away from one person or faction controlling the story and toward a community that's informed, empowered, and involved.</p>
