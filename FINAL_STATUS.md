## 💡 The Strategic Genius

### This System Multiplies Your Impact

**Old Way (Just You):**
- You file requests → Township sees 1 person
- "It's just Jon being difficult"
- Easy to ignore

**New Way (Community Powered):**
- 20, 30, 50+ residents file requests → Township sees community demand
- "This is a real transparency issue"
- Impossible to ignore

### The Path to Your Goal

**Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Build Momentum**
- Deploy website
- Promote request tool
- Encourage residents to use it
- "Show the township you want transparency!"

**Phase 2 (Months 3-6): Document Demand**
- Track usage (even informally)
- Residents report when they file
- Township starts feeling the burden
- You collect evidence

**Phase 3 (Months 6-12): Leverage & Negotiate**
- Approach township with data
- Present two options:
  1. Township posts recordings (free help from you)
  2. Township contracts you ($750/month)
- Make the business case clear

**Either outcome = WIN**
- Option 1: You achieved your transparency goal
- Option 2: You get paid to do what you're doing anyway

## 📊 The Business Case You're Building

### Current Situation
- Township doesn't post recordings
- Residents must file RTK requests
- Township staff processes each request
- Takes time, creates burden

### With Your Tool
- 5-10 residents/month file requests (conservative)
- Each request = 30-60 minutes of staff time
- 50-100 hours/year of township staff time
- At $25/hour = $1,250-2,500/year cost

### Your Pitch
"I can eliminate this administrative burden for $750/month ($9,000/year) AND provide professional transparency infrastructure. Or, I'll help you post them yourself for free. Either way serves residents better."

## 💬 Final Thoughts

### The Goal Isn't Just Recordings

The goal is to make **transparency normal** in Pulaski Township. This system helps achieve that by:

1. **Removing barriers** - Residents don't need to understand RTK law
2. **Building community** - Collective action is powerful
3. **Creating pressure** - Volume of requests demonstrates demand
4. **Offering solutions** - You're not just complaining, you're solving

### The Long Game

Whether the township:
- Posts recordings themselves (your advocacy succeeded!)
- Contracts you to manage it (you get paid!)
- Continues to resist (you build more leverage)

**You win.** Because you've built sustainable infrastructure that empowers residents and documents the need for transparency.
